## EcoEquity: A personal full-stack investment platform built using React, Spring Boot, MongoDB, HTML5, and CSS3

Some key features of EcoEquity:  
- Dynamic Financial Portal Creation: I developed a system that allows users to actively manage their stock market investments. The platform retrieves and displays stock prices with less than a 1-second delay, ensuring real-time insights.  
- Community Interaction Forum: I built a feature-rich discussion space where users can browse and contribute comments on specific stocks with full CRUD functionality.  

What made EcoEquity my favorite project was that I built everything from scratch. Unlike my previous projects, where I started coding and later thought about design, this time I followed proper software development standards—starting with high-level and low-level design before diving into implementation. This approach gave me a much deeper understanding of why structured development models are essential for large-scale applications.  

Additionally, this project had real-world utility for me—I was able to track my favorite stocks and capture their key metrics for free using the site. It felt incredibly rewarding to develop something that was not only technically challenging but also personally valuable.
